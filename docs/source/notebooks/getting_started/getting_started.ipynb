    "Very simply put the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a mathematical technique used to decompose a matrix (our data) into a number of left and right singular vectors and their corresponding 'weights' (the singular values). It allows us to quickly visualize the 'rank' of the matrix (which gives us a rough approximation of how many decay components we might need in our model to fit the data). \n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, the SVD decomposed a (data) matrix into three other matrices. It is often used in signal processing and statistics to identify patterns in data. Specifically, SVD decomposes a matrix \\(A\\) into three matrices \\(U\\), \\(Σ\\), and \\(V^T\\) such that \\(A = UΣV^T\\). Here, \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are orthogonal matrices, and \\(Σ\\) is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values. The left singular vectors (columns of \\(U\\)) represent the time coordinates, while the right singular vectors (columns of \\(V\\)) represent the spectral coordinates. The singular values in \\(Σ\\) provide a measure of the importance of each corresponding singular vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put simply: if we take the first left singular vector (LSV), multiply it by the first singular value (SV), and then multiply by the first right singular vector (RSV), we obtain the first approximation of the data matrix. Repeating this process for the second and third singular vectors provides an even better approximation, especially since the rank of this particular matrix appears to be 3. By summing the products of all the left and right singular vectors, each weighted by their corresponding singular value, we can reconstruct the original data matrix.\n",
