## Background Information

### Description

This example illustrates the global and target analysis of the time-resolved emission of a Photosystem I (PS-I) system following excitation at 400 nm. It loosely follows the analysis as described in the 2001 publication titled [Time-Resolved Fluorescence Emission Measurements of Photosystem I Particles of Various Cyanobacteria: A Unified Compartmental Model](https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(01)75709-8). The sample in question is described as "Trimeric core of Spirulina platensis" in the referenced publication. Figure 4E of the publication (partially reproduced below) depicts the results of (global) analysis of the data, in the form of the "Decay Associated Spectra of fluorescence decay". Figure 5 (reproduced below) details the "Compartmental model describing the kinetics of different cyanobacterial PS-I core particles upon excitation at 400â€…nm".
