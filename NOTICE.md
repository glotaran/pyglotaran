# Usage notice for scientists

## Disclaimer

This software package is made available as an early access release, to the advantage of the (scientific) community who wishes to make use of it before it has fully matured, but without any warranties.

Anyone using this package for serious work - scientists and academic users in particular - are cautioned, and treat it as any other instrument or tool that requires calibration or validation. Also be prepared for some refactoring of models or analysis specifications, sometime down the line.

## Scientific usage

That said, the pyglotaran package has been used in several peer-reviewed scientific publications, and it has been partially cross-validated against comparable software, such as the [R-package TIMP](https://dx.doi.org/10.18637/jss.v018.i03), and the TIM software described in [this publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2004.04.011) ([DOI: 10.1016/j.bbabio.2004.04.011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2004.04.011)).

The examples used in this validation process can be obtained from the [pyglotaran-examples repository](https://github.com/glotaran/pyglotaran-examples).

Since the early access version `v0.6.0` it was used in scientific teaching by a number of students in the Photosynthesis and Energy course from 2022-2024 under the supervision of [dr. Ivo van Stokkum](https://www.nat.vu.nl/~ivo/) ([profile](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/ihm-van-stokkum), github: [ism200](https://github.com/ism200/)).
